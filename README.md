## GrindStone

GrindStone is a small bash script i wrote that can be used to turn your life into a RPG and gamify your goals. Whenever you complete a task you earn coins which can be used for purchashing stuff like insta scroll time, anime episodes, et cetra.

I wrote it according to my goals but you can edit the file to make it match your goals.
